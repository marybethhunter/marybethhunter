<h1>Hi, I'm Mary Beth (she/her) 🪴🧘🏻‍♀️☕️</h1>

I’m a recent Nashville Software School grad (shout out cohort E16) currently working as an Associate Developer for GS&F in Nashville. I've always been drawn to tech and spent many a year on freecodecamp trying to learn HTML. I took the NSS plunge in July of 2020 and get to do this for a living now. The dream :) Personally, I am a yoga teacher, avid reader, coffee drinker, and plant collector. I also enjoy being outdoors, seeing live music, and spending time with my partner and son.
