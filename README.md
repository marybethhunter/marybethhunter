<h1>Hi, I'm Mary Beth (she/her) 🪴🧘🏻‍♀️☕️</h1>

I live in Tupelo, MS with my partner Lauren and 6-year old son Skye. We like to hike, see live music, play Pokemon Go, and go to as many estate sales as humanly possible. Personally, I spend most of my free time reading, drinking coffee, and caring for all our houseplants.

Before joining the team at Auth0, I was primarily a front-end developer at GS&F, an advertising agency based out of Nashville, TN. I attended Nashville Software School during the pandemic and received their Web Development certificate. Prior to that career change, I was in IT at the University of Mississippi for several years.
